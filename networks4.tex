\section{}
\subsection{}
For every $\frac{1}{t}$, $\alpha$ infected individuals become recovered, regardless of their contact with other individuals, hence $I\rightarrow-\alpha{I}$.\\
For every $\frac{1}{t}$, $\beta$ susceptible individuals become infected, hence $S\rightarrow-\beta{S}\frac{I}{N}$.\\
Susceptible individuals cannot become recovered.\\
Thus, $\frac{dS}{dt}=-\beta{S}\frac{I}{N}$.\\
For every $\frac{1}{t}$, $\beta$ susceptible individuals become infected, provided that they contact infected individuals, but the probability to meet an infected individual is $\frac{I}{N}$, hence $S\rightarrow\beta{S}\frac{I}{N}$.\\
Thus, $\frac{dI}{dt}=-\alpha{I}+\beta{S}\frac{I}{N}$.\\
For every $\frac{1}{t}$, $\alpha$ infected individuals become recovered, regardless of their contact with others, hence $R\rightarrow\alpha{I}$.\\
Thus, $\frac{dR}{dt}=\alpha{I}$.\\
The sum of derivatives is $\frac{dS}{dt}+\frac{dI}{dt}+\frac{dR}{dt}=-\beta{S}\frac{I}{N}-\alpha{I}+\beta{S}\frac{I}{N}+\alpha{I}=0$.\\
Normalized equations are
$\frac{ds}{dt}=-\beta{s}j$, $\frac{dj}{dt}=-\alpha{j}+\beta{s}j$ and $\frac{dr}{dt}=\alpha{j}$, which also sum up to zero.
\subsection{}
$\frac{dj}{dt}=-\alpha{j}+\beta{s}j$, like in the SIS model.
Intuitively speaking, the healthy state is stable, if we calculate the percentage of infected individuals $j$s, because like in the SIS model, a $\delta$ of infected will recover before they infect others, only in this model they will become recovered rather than susceptible.\\
But in the SIR model, $s$ is not the complement of $j$ but rather of $j+r$, hence 
$\frac{dj}{dt}=-\alpha{j}+\beta{s}j=-\alpha{j}+\beta{j}(1-j-r)=f(j,r)$, so we need also the equation
$\frac{dr}{dt}=\alpha{j}$, meaning that $\frac{dr}{dt}$ does not depend on $r$, but then $\frac{d\delta{r}}{dt}=\alpha\delta{j}$.\\
$\frac{d\delta{j}}{dt}=\frac{df}{dr}(j_0,\delta{r})+\frac{df}{dj}(\delta{j},r_0)=-\beta{j_0}\delta{r}+\frac{df}{dj}(\delta{j},r_0)=0+\frac{df}{dj}(\delta{j},r_0)=\frac{d\delta{j}}{dt}$, hence the $j$ perturbation in the SIR model is identical to the SIS model.
